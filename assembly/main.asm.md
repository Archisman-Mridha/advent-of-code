`rax` and `rdi` are registers in the x86-64 processor architecture.

RAX is a general-purpose register that is 64 bits wide and is used for many purposes. It is often used to hold return values from functions and to perform arithmetic and logical operations. RAX is also used as an accumulator for some instructions.

RDI is another general-purpose register that is 64 bits wide. It is commonly used as a pointer to the first argument passed to a function in the x86-64 calling convention.
