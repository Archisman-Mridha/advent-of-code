# Assembly

- What is an `assembler` ?
    An assembler is a program that **translates assembly language code into machine code** that can be executed by a computer's processor. Assembly language is a low-level programming language that uses mnemonics to represent the processor's instructions, while machine code is the binary representation of those instructions that can be executed by the processor.

    `NASM` is an assembler, which we are using here to convert assembly code to machine code.
